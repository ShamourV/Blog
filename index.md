## Welcome to my WorkED experience


My first day of this work experience was how most would go. Simple introductions of who everyone is and what their interests are went smoothly. I was expecting to learn new things since I was not a part of the cybersecurity pathway instead I was a full-stack development student. I learned things and got opportunities that most teens or people never got the chance to learn about. I was excited to go into this work field with the little knowledge I know.

During these weeks I learned more about cybersecurity and I am proud to say I wouldnâ€™t have learned it without the help of my supervisors and all the amazing guests they brought in. I would like to thank them for taking the time out of their day to teach us these skills which we all plan to use in the future. Though projects were tough with their guidance I was able to push through them and finish them all before their deadline. I know that the projects I presented were not perfect, they were a small work in progress and my supervisors including my fellow peers knew that(I know that nothing is perfect, it's ok).

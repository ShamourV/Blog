# Peak fiction Wall-E

## The Role of AI.

The role of AI in the movie Wall-E was so that humans could be lazy and rely on robots to do everything for them. Wall-E are depicted as basic AI with only one purpose until later in the movie where they seem to have gained a kind of relation with each other. Auto had a singular motive and that was to keep the ship in one direction. While Wall-E interacted with the humans on a emotional level auto kept the humans on a singular coarse not wanting them to go home.

## What were the consequences of AI and how did it affect the people?

There were many consequences in Wall-E. One of them was the action of the humans that put to much dirt on the earth and poisoning the planet. Another was the auto pilot which did everything for them causing them to become lazy and forget how to even walk. The planet had barely any life on the planet its only survivors being a singular plant and a few roaches. This could relate to real world  ethics since most people rely on auto-pilot when driving their tesla.

## Did the AI have a sort of human connection?

Wall-E and EVE had a connection with humans when it came down to the emotional level. The bond between EVE and Wall-E showed us that even AI could possibly gain human emotions and grow to be just like us. These issues can relate to the real world since if an AI takes over human jobs like therapy then they could actually relate to their human patient on an emotional level.

## Did the movie Wall-E envision society in about 50-100 years?

The movie visualized how we humans would act almost accurately. True that some people(probably myself) would grow to become lazy and do nothing there would be a group of people that wouldn't agree with becoming like that. They would stay active and not rely on auto pilot or anything automative. They would live on the ship with the other humans but they wouldn't just sit around doing absolutely nothing.

Wonder if anyone reading my blog post(besides my teacher) ever worked with panda.
Well since I am question that might as well give a small explantion.
Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. Hope this gives a small explanation to what it is and what it does.
Using Panda I was able to graph all the survivors in the titanic.

Using this piece of code I was able to see all the passengers, their age, their sex, and their class with this I was able to formulate a graph of all the people who survived

This is an image of the graph I was able to create of all the survivors. It shows how many woman survived compared to men survivors. I really struggled with this one. I wonder if anyone else did. Hopefully not as bad as I did.
